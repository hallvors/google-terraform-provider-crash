# Slipway-modules

This repository contains re-usable Terraform modules for shipping stuff to Google cloud.

These modules can be used for example from the Slipway project. This way to organise the infrastructure provisioning code is based on Gruntwork's "Introduction to Terraform" article series, in particular this one:
https://blog.gruntwork.io/how-to-create-reusable-infrastructure-with-terraform-modules-25526d65f73d?gi=230cda2839d7

Most of the time, projects that need provisioning and deployment assistance will be using code in the Slipway repository, which will again reference this repo.
